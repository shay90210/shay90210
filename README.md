## Introduction 
I am an ex-educator :teacher: and an ex-healthcare worker :health_worker: transitioning into tech. I taught myself the web development scripting languages, then started a bootcamp to learn about UI frameworks, UI libraries and the backend languages and relational databases to become a full-stack software engineer. I am creative, detail-oriented, and results-driven. Therefore, you can count on me when it comes to any project.
