I am a recent teacher and healthcare worker looking to transition into tech. I taught myself the scripting languages, then started a bootcamp to learn about frameworks, libraries and the backend duties of a software engineer. I am creative, detail-oriented, and results-driver. Therefore, you can count on me when it comes to any project.
