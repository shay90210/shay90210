## INTRODUCTION :
I’m a driven career-changer with experience in education, healthcare, and technical support for enterprise timekeeping systems. That mix gives me a strong user-centered perspective as I grow in software development. I’m currently strengthening my technical foundation through Nucamp and self-directed projects focused on HTML, CSS, Ruby with Sinatra, Python with Django, and MongoDB, while also building skills in data structures, algorithms, and modern development practices.

My interest in software engineering naturally overlaps with cybersecurity, where I’m exploring secure coding, access control, and threat mitigation. My long-term goal is to build safe, intuitive, and scalable applications that genuinely support users and organizations.
