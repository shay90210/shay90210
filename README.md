## INTRODUCTION :
As a new learner with a passion for technology, I am continuously learning about the intricacies of the industry. My pre-apprenticeship and self-motivation have enabled me to acquire skills in HTML, CSS, and Ruby. I am currently expanding my knowledge on Python, Ruby on Rails, data structures, and algorithms.

My interest in software engineering extends to cybersecurity, and I am exploring opportunities in this area to understand how software can be developed and secured to mitigate potential cyber threats. By combining my knowledge of software engineering with cybersecurity, I aim to create innovative and secure applications that will keep both users and organizations safe.
