## INTRODUCTION :
As a driven career-changer with a background in education, healthcare, and technical support for timekeeping systems, I bring a user-centered perspective to software development. I’m currently building my technical foundation through a learning from Nucamp and through self-directed projects that strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, Python/Django, & MongoDB. I’m also expanding my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and modern development practices.

My growing interest in software engineering naturally extends into cybersecurity, where I’m exploring how secure coding principles, access control, and threat mitigation intersect with building reliable applications. My goal is to combine my technical training with real-world experience to create safe, intuitive, and scalable software that supports both users and organizations.
